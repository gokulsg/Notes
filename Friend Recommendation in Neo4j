This Algorithm uses the power of Neo4j in recommending friends to the users.

The algorithm is :

Function Recommend user( )
{
	// input : nodes and their relationship
	// output : List of friends to recommend to user
	Mutual = count of mutual friends
  If (gender of user = gender of potential friend)	
    Score = score+10
  If (location of user = location of potential friend)	
    Score = score+10
  Diff_age = age_of_user - age_of_potential friend
  Score = Diff_age + Mutual
  // Sort the friends by the score
  // Limit the number of recommendations to three
  //Recommend friend based on users having highest score value
}

This algorithm will calculate the number of mutual friends a person have and normalize this value to avoid this value to take advantage over all the other values (Dispropositionate effect)

The it calculate the age difference and the people of the same age group gets higher preference.
Also the people of same gender and people who are living in same location gets higher preference.

This algorithm helps in connecting the like minded people across the globe together.
